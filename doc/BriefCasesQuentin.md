## Brief Cases assigned to Quentin

### UC2: Start a Game
A user can start a new game by launching the application.

### UC4: Create a link
A player (AI or user) can click on a node (origin) and click on another one (end) to create a link between the two.
This action does nothing if the origin node isn't controlled.
If a link is already present between the origin and the end nodes the link is removed.

### UC8: Set AI difficulty
At the start of the game the player can change the difficulty of the AI (easy, medium, hard).

### UC9: Attack (Enemy Node)
Is a type of UC4. Can be used by the player and the AI.
The resources sent by the origin node reduce the resources of the end node (same goes for the production).

### UC12: Update Map (Timer)
Used by the system. Update all the nodes each second.
