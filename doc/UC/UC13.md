##UC13: Generate Map

###Summary
The system must generate a map before the game begin. The map is a graph with a number of nodes and edges defined randomly.

###Scenarios
The system creates a random graph with serial nodes and possible links between each nodes. (all links are not authorised)
The system defines two random variables: one for the number of nodes and another one for the number of edges.
A limit is defined on these numbers to have a possible graph. 
if an error occurred and the system displays an error message and restart the map generation.
