### Primary Actor

System

### Goal

Modify the size of a specific node resulting in the increasing or decreasing of its productivity.

### Scope

The game

### Stakeholders and Interest

System :
**Change the node image**

The node belong to a player

### Trigger

The node rise above 10, 25, 50, 100 resources
The node fall below 10, 25, 50, 100 resources

### Success Guarantees

The node image changes

### Scenarios

**Success**

From 1 to 9 resources, the node is a "House" and it productivity is 1 resource per second
From 10 to 24 resources, the node is a "Tribe" and it productivity is 2 resource per second
From 25 to 49 resources, the node is a "Town" and it productivity is 3 resource per second
From 50 to 99 resources, the node is a "City" and it productivity is 4 resource per second
Above 100 resources, the node is a "Capital" and it productivity is 5 resource per second
