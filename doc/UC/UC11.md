## UC11: Modify Nodes

###Summary

Done by the System, if a node reach a certain resource amount, the node grows stronger, resulting in the improvement of the productivity.
Moreover, if a node resources decrease lower than a certain amount, the node shrinks, resulting in the decreasing of the productivity.

### Primary Actor

System

### Goal

Modify the size of a specific node, this results in the increase or decrease of its productivity.

### Scope

The game

### Stakeholders and Interests

* **System :** Change the node image
* **System :** Change the node productivity

### Precondition

The node belongs to a player

### Trigger

* The node rises above 10, 25, 50, 100 resources
* The node falls below 10, 25, 50, 100 resources

### Success Guarantees

The node image changes

### Scenarios

**Success**

* From 1 to 9 resources, the node is a "House", its productivity is 1 resource per second and it can be the "Origin" of 1 link
* From 10 to 24 resources, the node is a "Tribe", its productivity is 2 resource per second and it can be the "Origin" of 2 link
* From 25 to 49 resources, the node is a "Town", its productivity is 3 resource per second and it can be the "Origin" of 3 link
* From 50 to 99 resources, the node is a "City", its productivity is 4 resource per second and it can be the "Origin" of 4 link
* Above 100 resources, the node is a "Capital", its productivity is 5 resource per second and it can be the "Origin" of 5 link
