### Trigger

* The node rises above 10, 25, 50, 100 resources
* The node falls below 10, 25, 50, 100 resources

### Success Guarantees

The node image changes

### Scenarios

**Success**

* From 1 to 9 resources, the node is a "House" and its productivity is 1 resource per second
* From 10 to 24 resources, the node is a "Tribe" and its productivity is 2 resource per second
* From 25 to 49 resources, the node is a "Town" and its productivity is 3 resource per second
* From 50 to 99 resources, the node is a "City" and its productivity is 4 resource per second
