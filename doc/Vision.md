# Vison of HairVikings
HairViking is a very simple strategic game. At the start of the game you and your opponent (AI) have one city (Node).
Other cities are on the map and considered as neutral. Your goal is to capture the opponent base by reducing it's hair value (A unit on each node).
To do so, each player has to capture neutral nodes (by linking them from the base) and control them to reach the opponent base.
Each time a player link two node together, half of the hair on the origin node is added to the target node.
Each node captured replenish themselves at a slow pace (except the base one which is faster).
